    <h2>Group Projects</h2>
    <h3>Robert</h3>
    
    <p>As a team, we have successfully created a fascinating project using Arduino Uno. Our project utilizes a sensor to detect the presence of people, and the highlight of our creation is an impressive eyeball mechanism that dynamically follows the detected person's movements. The combination of advanced sensor technology and precise motor control brings this interactive experience to life. We are proud of our achievement and the seamless integration of hardware and software components in this innovative project.</p>
